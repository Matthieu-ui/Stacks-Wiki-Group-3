# Stacks-Wiki-Group-3
What Stack Should I choose, And Why

Project name: Stacks-Wiki-Group-3
What Stack Should I choose, And Why

Description: A Group GitHub repository for the assignment
A multi-page wiki (one page per group member)
Must include a Table Of Contents with links to each team member's page
must have a home page that states topic of the wiki, as well as a brief summary of the contents and a link to the TOC.
Final Deliverable is the URL of the home page. ALL GROUP MEMBERS MUST TURN IN THE LINK SEPARATELY!

Group Roles: 

Your group may or may not want to consider assigning/volunteering for one or more of the following roles for this wiki project:

Team Lead
Editor
Researcher
Repo/Wiki Owner
The above list is in no way comprehensive, nor does it represent concrete roles that MUST be assigned.

Performing a specific role DOES NOT mean that you do not have to write a wiki page in addition to your role.

Even though this is a group assignment, each team member will be graded individually based on their contribution to the wiki (their page).

Slowly figuring this out!!
